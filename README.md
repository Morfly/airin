## Overview
To facilitate the migration of Android apps to Bazel, Airin provides a Gradle plugin that upon configuration, 
analyzes the Gradle project structure and replicates it with Bazel by generating the corresponding Bazel files.

To enable Starlark code generation in Kotlin, Airin is bundled with [Pendant](https://github.com/Morfly/pendant), 
an open-source declarative and type-safe Starlark code generator.

> You can learn more about Airin and the design behind it in a [blog post](https://morfly.medium.com/6dc79d298628) at Turo Engineering.

### Installation
Apply Airin Gradle plugin in your root `build.gradle.kts` file.
```kotlin
// root build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("io.morfly.airin.android") version "x.y.z"
}
```
### Configuration
Next, in the same `build.gradle.kts` file, use the `airin` extension to configure the plugin and adjust it specifically 
for your project.

```kotlin
// root build.gradle.kts
airin {
    targets += setOf(":app")

    register<AndroidLibraryModule> {
        include<JetpackComposeFeature>()
        include<HiltFeature>()
        include<ParcelizeFeature>()
    }
    register<JvmLibraryModule>()

    register<RootModule> {
        include<AndroidToolchainFeature>()
    }
}
```
A few things are happening in the script above:
- An`app` module and all its dependencies will be migrated to Bazel.
- Modules classified as Android library, JVM library and root module will be migrated to Bazel.
- If any Android library module optionally uses technologies like Jetpack Compose, Hilt or Parcelize, they will be reflected in Bazel too.

Continue reading the documentation to find more details about components and plugin configuration.

### Migration
Finally, after the plugin is configured, the migration to Bazel is triggered with a corresponding Gradle task.
```shell
./gradlew app:migrateToBazel --no-configure-on-demand
```

> Airin plugin needs to analyze the project dependency graph during the configuration phase. 
> Therefore, [configuration on demand](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_configuration_and_execution.html#sec:configuration_on_demand) must be disabled when running the migration. 

## Gradle plugin

### Configuration options
To configure Airin Gradle plugin use `airin` extension in the root `build.gradle.kts` file.

- `targets` - configure migration targets. A `migrateToBazel` task as assigned to each migration target and triggers the migration for all its dependencies as well as the root module of the project.
- `skippedProjects` - ignore these Gradle projects during the Bazel migration.
- `configurations` - specify allowed Gradle dependency configurations during the migration. All the rest dependencies will be ignored in Bazel.
- `register` - register a [module component](#module-components) that targets a specific type of modules. See [module components](#module-components).
- `include` - include a [feature component](#feature-components) in a module component that targets specific build features included in the module. Must be applied under the specific module component. See [feature components](#feature-components).
- `onComponentConflict` - configure the behavior when Airin finds more then one module component that can migrate a module.
  - `Fail` - fail the build.
  - `UsePriority` - pick one with higher priority.
  - `Ignore` - ignore the module.
- `onMissingComponent` - configure the behavior when Airin can't find any module component to migrate a module.
  - `Fail` - fail the build.
  - `Ignore` - ignore the module.
- `decorateWith` - register a custom module decorator. See [decorators](#decorators).

### Gradle tasks
- `migrateToBazel` - registered for each migration target that is explicitly specified in `airin` plugin extension. Triggers the migration for the module, its direct and transitive dependencies and a root module.
- `migrateProjectToBazel` - registered for all dependencies of migration targets. Triggers migration only for this module.
- `migrateRootToBazelFor***` - registered for a root project and complements migration for specific migration target, where the `***` is a name of a migration target. E.g. `:migrateRootToBazelForApp`.

## Module components
Module component is responsible for generating Bazel files for specific types of modules.

Every module component is an abstract class that extends the ModuleComponent base class and implements 2 functions, `canProcess` and `onInvoke`.

It is declared in `buildSrc`, or any other type of module that is included in the classpath of your build configuration.

```kotlin
abstract class AndroidLibraryModule : ModuleComponent {

  override fun canProcess(project: Project): Boolean {...}

  override fun ModuleContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) {...}
}
```

- `canProcess` is invoked during the Gradle Configuration phase and is aimed to filter Gradle modules to which this component is applicable. Only one module component can be selected for every module in the codebase.
- `onInvoke` is invoked during the Gradle Execution phase and contains the main logic of the component the purpose of which is to generate Bazel files for the module.

The easiest way to determine the module type is by examining its applied plugins. For example, an Android library module in Gradle typically relies upon the `com.android.library` plugin.

```kotlin
abstract class AndroidLibraryModule : ModuleComponent {

  override fun canProcess(project: Project): Boolean =
    project.plugins.hasPlugin("com.android.library")
}
```
### Generating Bazel files
The main responsibility of module components is generating Bazel files. 
To do this, Airin leverages Pendant, a Kotlin DSL that provides a declarative API for generating Starlark code. This is done in `onInvoke`.

```kotlin
abstract class AndroidLibraryModule : ModuleComponent {

  override fun ModuleContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) { 
    val file = BUILD.bazel {
        ...
    }
    generate(file)
  }
}
```
You can use various builders for different types of Bazel types.
```kotlin
val build = BUILD { ... }
val buildWithExt = BUILD.bazel { ... }
val workspace = WORKSPACE { ... }
val workspaceWithExt = WORKSPACE.bazel { ... }
val mavenDependencies = "maven_dependencies".bzl { ... }
```
To write the file in the file system, use `generate` call. By default, the file is generated in the same directory as the currently processed module. 
Additionally, you can use `relativePath` to specify a subdirectory for a generated file.
```kotlin
generate(build)
generate(mavenDependencies, relativePath = "third_party")
```

The actual content of a generated Starlark file is built using [Pendant](https://github.com/Morfly/pendant).

```kotlin
override fun ModuleContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) {
  val file = BUILD.bazel {
    load("@io_bazel_rules_kotlin//kotlin:android.bzl", "kt_android_library")
  
    kt_android_library {
      name = module.name
      srcs = glob("src/main/**/*.kt")
      custom_package = module.androidMetadata?.packageName
      manifest = "src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
      resource_files = glob("src/main/res/**")
    }
  }

  generate(file)
}
```

> You can find an in-depth overview of Pendant on [GitHub](https://github.com/Morfly/pendant) and in the talk at [droidcon NYC 2022](https://www.droidcon.com/2022/09/29/advanced-techniques-for-building-kotlin-dsls/).

### Dependencies
A Bazel target can possess various types of dependencies, each represented by different function parameters.

```python
# BUILD.bazel
kt_android_library(
  ...
  deps = [...],
  exports = [...],
  plugins = [...],
)
```
A `GradleModule` instance provides dependencies mapped per configuration, represented with an argument name. To designate dependencies in the generated code, the `=` function (enclosed in backticks) is used to represent an argument passed to a function.

```python
kt_android_library {
  ...
  for ((config, deps) in module.dependencies) {
    config `=` deps.map { it.asBazelLabel().toString() }
  }
}
```
As a result, the following Starlark code is generated.

```python
# generated Bazel script
kt_android_library(
  ...
  plugins = [...],
  deps = [...],
  exports = [...],
)
```
## Feature components
Feature component is responsible for contributing to Bazel files generated by a related module component based on a specific build feature.

Every feature component is an abstract class that extends the FeatureComponent base class and implements 2 functions, canProcess and onInvoke.

It is declared in `buildSrc`, or any other type of module that is included in the classpath of your build configuration.

```kotlin
abstract class JetpackComposeFeature : FeatureComponent() {

  override fun canProcess(project: Project): Boolean {...}

  override fun FeatureContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) {...}
}
```
`canProcess` is invoked during the Gradle Configuration phase and is aimed to filter Gradle modules to which this component is applicable.

`onInvoke` is invoked during the Gradle Execution phase and contains the main logic of the component. Its purpose is to modify Bazel files generated by a related module component as well as manage the dependencies of the module.

### Dependency overrides
### Configuration overrides
### File modifiers
## Shared components
The purpose of shared components is to enable feature components to contribute into multiple module components.

There could be multiple types of shared components.
- **Shared module component** â€” receives contributions from every shared feature component, even if it is not directly included in it.
- **Shared feature component** â€” contributes to every shared module component.
- **Top-level feature component** â€” does not belong to any module component specifically and contributes to all module components, even non-shared ones.

This is how they are declared in a Gradle plugin.

```kotlin
// root build.gradle.kts
airin {
  register<AndroidLibraryModule> {
    // shared feature component
    include<HiltFeature> { shared = true }
  }

  // shared module component
  register<RootModule> { shared = true }

  // top-level feature component
  include<AllPublicFeature>()
}
```
Here is what's happening in the example above.
- `HiltFeature` - feature component that configures Hilt for a Bazel module.
  - Contributes to `AndroidLibraryModule` because they are directly connected. Includes Hilt in Bazel scripts in each Android library module.
  - Contributes to `RootModule` because they are both shared. Configures Hilt in a Bazel workspace.
- `AllPublicFeature` - feature component that configures default public visibility in a Bazel file.
  - contributes to `AndroidLibraryModule` and `RootModule` because it's a top-level feature component.

> Refer to examples of [`AndroidLibraryModule`](https://github.com/Morfly/airin/blob/d2810f569b5da84ec61106a8c85d2b3566b1f7a8/airin-gradle-android/src/main/kotlin/io/morfly/airin/module/AndroidLibraryModule.kt), 
> [`HiltFeature`](https://github.com/Morfly/airin/blob/d2810f569b5da84ec61106a8c85d2b3566b1f7a8/airin-gradle-android/src/main/kotlin/io/morfly/airin/feature/HiltFeature.kt) 
> and [`RootModule`](https://github.com/Morfly/airin/blob/d2810f569b5da84ec61106a8c85d2b3566b1f7a8/airin-gradle-android/src/main/kotlin/io/morfly/airin/module/RootModule.kt) to learn more.

## Properties
Both module and feature components offer an API for declaring properties, that serve as arguments that allow additional customization when configuring `airin` plugin.  
```kotlin
// root build.gradle.kts
airin {
  register<RootModule> {
    include<AndroidToolchainFeature> {
      rulesKotlinVersion = "1.8.1"
      rulesKotlinSha = "a630cda9fdb4f56cf2dc20a4bf873765c41cf00e9379e8d59cd07b24730f4fde"
    }
  }
}
```
To declare a property in a custom component use `property` delegate and provide a default value.
```kotlin
abstract class AndroidToolchainFeature : FeatureComponent() {
  val rulesKotlinVersion: String by property(default = "1.8.1")
  val rulesKotlinSha: String by property(default = "a630cda9fdb4f56cf2dc20a4bf873765c41cf00e9379e8d59cd07b24730f4fde")

  override fun FeatureContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) {
    ...
  }
}
```

> Refer to the example of [`AndroidToolchainFeature`](https://github.com/Morfly/airin/blob/d2810f569b5da84ec61106a8c85d2b3566b1f7a8/airin-gradle-android/src/main/kotlin/io/morfly/airin/feature/AndroidToolchainFeature.kt) to learn more.

### Default properties
There are a few default properties that are available in each component.
- `shared` - makes a component shared, as described in [shared components](#shared-components) section.
- `ignored` - excludes the component from the migration process.
- `priority` - applied only to module components and defines the priority of the component. It complements `ComponentConflictResolution.UsePriority`, so that a component with a highest priority is select for a module in case of a conflict.

### Shared properties
Regular properties are defined during the Gradle configuration phase and are common in all modules that use a certain component.

Shared properties, on the other hand, are used during the Gradle execution phase and allow sharing the data between related module and shared components within a single module.

```kotlin
abstract class HiltFeature : FeatureComponent() {
    override fun FeatureContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) {
        sharedProperties["myProperty"] = "value"
    }
}
```

```kotlin
abstract class AndroidLibraryModule : FeatureComponent() {
    override fun FeatureContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) {
        val myProperty = sharedProperties["myProperty"] as String
    }
}
```

The components are invoked following the order specified in `airin` extension, so that for each module, feature components are invoked prior to the module component.
## Decorators
Decorators allow extracting an additional information about Gradle modules that will automatically decorate instances of `GradleModule` in
`onInvoke` calls of each module and feature component during the migration.

By default, `io.morfly.airin.android` Gradle plugin employs [`AndroidModuleDecorator`](https://github.com/Morfly/airin/blob/3bad5940d680423d3af130e1053a04b7e7d78a72/airin-gradle-android/src/main/kotlin/io/morfly/airin/AndroidModuleDecorator.kt). 
Its purpose is to provide additional information about modules extracted from Android Gradle plugin, such as package name, enabled build features, etc.

The simple example of a module decorator could be found below.
```kotlin
open class AndroidModuleDecorator : GradleModuleDecorator {

  override fun GradleModule.decorate(project: Project) { 
    // make sure this is the right type of modules
    if (!project.plugins.hasPlugin("com.android.library")) return
        
    // prepared the additional data
    val androidMetadata = AndroidMetadata(
      namespace = extensions.findByType(CommonExtension::class.java)?.namespace
    )
      
    // decorate the module instance
    this.properties["androidMetadata"] = androidMetadata
  }
}
```
After the decorator is declared, all that is left is to apply it in the `airin` plugin configuration.
```kotlin
// root build.gradle.kts
airin {
    decorateWith<AndroidModuleDecorator>()
}
```

As a result, you can extract this data in your custom components.
```kotlin
abstract class MyFeatureComponent : FeatureComponent() {

    override fun FeatureContext.onInvoke(module: GradleModule) {
        val myData = module.properties["androidMetadata"]
    }
}
```
