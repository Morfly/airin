## Overview
To facilitate the migration of Android apps to Bazel, Airin provides a Gradle plugin. This plugin, upon configuration, 
analyzes the Gradle project structure and replicates it with Bazel by generating the corresponding Bazel files.

### Installation
To initiate Bazel adoption, apply Airin Gradle plugin in your root `build.gradle.kts` file.
```kotlin
// root build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("io.morfly.airin.android") version "x.y.z"
}
```
### Configuration
Next, in the same `build.gradle.kts` file, use the `airin` extension to configure the plugin and adjust it specifically 
for your project.

```kotlin
// root build.gradle.kts
airin {
    targets += setOf(":app")

    register<AndroidLibraryModule> {
        include<JetpackComposeFeature>()
        include<HiltFeature>()
        include<ParcelizeFeature>()
    }
    register<JvmLibraryModule>()

    register<RootModule> {
        include<AndroidToolchainFeature>()
    }
}
```
Read next sections in the documentation to learn more about the available configuration options for the Airin plugin.

### Migration
Finally, after configuring the plugin, execute the corresponding Gradle task to initiate the automated migration to 
Bazel. This task will analyze the Gradle project structure and, based on the Airin plugin configuration, generate 
corresponding Bazel files within the project.
```shell
./gradlew app:migrateToBazel --no-configure-on-demand
```
## Gradle plugin
In most cases, your project will include custom Gradle logic or plugins that lack open-source Bazel alternatives. 
This necessitates the development of custom Bazel solutions for those specific cases. Once completed, these solutions 
can be incorporated into Airin, enabling it to generate the Starlark code exactly as you need.
